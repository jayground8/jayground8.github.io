summary: "I needed to set up a self-hosted Git system and was looking for an open-source tool that would fit my requirements. Gitea seemed like a great fit, and I was particularly interested in Gitea Actions, which is compatible with GitHub Actions. However, I struggled to correctly configure a Gitea Actions runner to use a container image from a private repository. Through that process, I gained a much better understanding of how Gitea offers a CI/CD system compatible with GitHub Actions. In this post, I'll share what I learned."

## Reason Why I Picked Gitea

I needed to run a self-hosted Git system instead of using a SaaS platform like GitHub or Bitbucket. My main requirements were that the solution be open-source and have a great web UI.

At first, GitHub Enterprise and GitLab Community Edition came to mind. However, GitHub Enterprise isn't open-source, which led me to believe that GitLab CE was the only option that met my criteria.

After a little more research, I found Gitea. A quick check revealed that it not only has a great web UI but also provides a CI/CD pipeline compatible with GitHub Actions. It also offers support for Git LFS and OAuth2 authentication.

I also prefer open-source projects that are maintained by a company that offers an enterprise version, as I believe this ensures better long-term reliability. Gitea fits this preference, with an enterprise option provided by the company CommitGo.

Finally, Gitea has a simpler architecture with fewer components (Gitea, PostgreSQL, Valkey, and an Act Runner) compared to GitLab. This was important to me because I sometimes need to modify Dockerfiles and build images from source to meet specific security requirements. For that reason, a system with fewer components was an advantage.

## Act

Gitea provides a CI/CD pipeline compatible with GitHub Actions by using the [open-source project Act](https://github.com/nektos/act). Act allows you to run GitHub Action workflows on your local machine by parsing the workflow specification and running it in a container environment via the Docker API. While GitHub Actions operate in a virtualized environment, Act uses a container environment, and the container it uses is called a Runner. You can configure which container image to use for this Runner.

Act provides a CLI that allows you to run workflows on your local machine. If Docker is running on your system, this single command will run the workflow specified in a file like ~/.github/workflows/something.yml. It's awesome!

```sh
act
```

Gitea forked "Act" and modified it to be used as a library for its own [Gitea Act Runner](https://gitea.com/gitea/act_runner). The Gitea Act Runner integrates with Gitea and runs workflows using this forked Act library. Gitea Act reads workflow files from the .gitea/workflows path instead of .github/workflows. However, the workflow specification is still compatible with GitHub Actions. That's why you can run your Gitea workflows with the Act CLI using the -W option, like below.

```sh
act -W ./.gitea/workflows/
```

## Private Image For Runner

[The Gitea Act Runner repository has examples for running it on Kubernetes](https://gitea.com/gitea/act_runner/src/tag/v0.2.12/examples/kubernetes/dind-docker.yaml). I started with the dind-docker.yaml example, and it was working great! In this setup, a container with the Docker-in-Docker (DinD) image runs as a sidecar. The Act Runner container communicates with this DinD container and creates new containers within it through the Gitea Act library.

This process was quick and smooth until I tried to use a container image from a private repository for my Runner. To run your own container image as a runner, you add it to the labels in the configuration.

```yaml
data:
  config.yaml: |
    log:
      level: debug

    runner:
      file: .runner
      capacity: 1
      timeout: 3h
      shutdown_timeout: 0s
      insecure: false
      fetch_timeout: 5s
      fetch_interval: 2s
      labels:
        - "ubuntu-latest:docker://docker.gitea.com/runner-images:ubuntu-latest"
        - "ubuntu-22.04:docker://my-private-repository.com/ubuntu:22.04"

    cache:
      enabled: false

    container:
      privileged: true
      docker_host: tcp://localhost:2376
      force_pull: false
      force_rebuild: false
```

I created a Kubernetes secret in the docker-registry format (`kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred`) to authenticate with my private container registry. My first thought was that the DinD container needed these credentials, so I mounted the secret volume onto that container. This assumption cost me a significant amount of time and led me down a rabbit hole into the source code. ðŸ¥¹

```yaml
- name: docker-config
    secret:
        secretName: regcred
```

```yaml
- name: docker-config
    mountPath: /root/.docker/config.json
    subPath: .dockerconfigjson
    readOnly: true
```

## How To Load Docker Config File

To cut to the chase, the Gitea Act Runner container needs the Docker authentication credentials, not the DinD container. The Act library itself is responsible for pulling images and running containers through the Docker API. Therefore, the Act Runner must be the one to make the authenticated request to the Docker daemon.

You can understand this better by looking at [the source code of Gitea Act](https://gitea.com/gitea/act/src/commit/9924aea78631d3e4e24a0eefb522e0aab1e7f4ab/pkg/container/docker_pull.go), specifically the LoadDockerAuthConfig method. It loads credentials from a .docker/config.json file and attaches them to the request for authentication.

```go
func getImagePullOptions(ctx context.Context, input NewDockerPullExecutorInput) (types.ImagePullOptions, error) {
	imagePullOptions := types.ImagePullOptions{
		Platform: input.Platform,
	}
	logger := common.Logger(ctx)

	if input.Username != "" && input.Password != "" {
		logger.Debugf("using authentication for docker pull")

		authConfig := registry.AuthConfig{
			Username: input.Username,
			Password: input.Password,
		}

		encodedJSON, err := json.Marshal(authConfig)
		if err != nil {
			return imagePullOptions, err
		}

		imagePullOptions.RegistryAuth = base64.URLEncoding.EncodeToString(encodedJSON)
	} else {
		authConfig, err := LoadDockerAuthConfig(ctx, input.Image)
		if err != nil {
			return imagePullOptions, err
		}
		if authConfig.Username == "" && authConfig.Password == "" {
			return imagePullOptions, nil
		}
		logger.Info("using DockerAuthConfig authentication for docker pull")

		encodedJSON, err := json.Marshal(authConfig)
		if err != nil {
			return imagePullOptions, err
		}

		imagePullOptions.RegistryAuth = base64.URLEncoding.EncodeToString(encodedJSON)
	}

	return imagePullOptions, nil
}
```

```

When your workflow uses the ubuntu-22.04 label, as shown below, the runner will pull the corresponding container image from the private registry you configured.

```yaml
name: Gitea Actions Demo
run-name: ${{ gitea.actor }} is testing out Gitea Actions ðŸš€
on: [push]

jobs:
  Explore-Gitea-Actions:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04

```

## Conclusion

In the end, I chose Gitea for my self-hosted Git system. Although I initially struggled to set up the Docker credentials correctly, the process led me to discover the fascinating open-source project, Act.

Understanding how Act works helped me realize that the Gitea Act Runner loads the Docker configuration file and passes it to the Docker daemon via the API. My journey with Gitea has just begun!
